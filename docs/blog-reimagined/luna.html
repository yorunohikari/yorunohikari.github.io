        <h1>Luna</h1>
        <p>It was mid-September, just as the rainy season had begun, when I had a strange dream. In it, I reconnected
            with my high school friend, Luna. The last time I saw her was at a barbecue party in 2012, about three years
            after we graduated. In the dream, I remembered everything in vivid detail. She called me, saying she had
            some questions about her work. I didn't mind—we had been close in high school, though time and our different
            paths had separated us.</p>

        <p>We talked for hours. While we only discussed her work for about half an hour, the rest of the time was spent
            reminiscing about our high school days. Somehow, we agreed to meet up. She worked near where I lived, so it
            felt like a natural reunion. We walked around town, enjoying each other's company, and had dinner afterward.
        </p>

        <p>I saw her so clearly—her pure smile, her dark eyes, and the faint freckles on her face. She seemed genuinely
            happy, as if something good had happened, though she never told me what. Strangely, I found myself talking a
            lot in the dream. Normally, I'm quiet and only speak when necessary, but this time, I felt an urgency to say
            everything on my mind, as if I might never get the chance to talk to her again.</p>

        <p>This vivid dream still lingers with me sometimes.</p>
