            <h2>Me and My Background</h2>
            <p>
                You might be wondering, who's this guy, and why should you invest your
                time reading this? Allow me to introduce myself and my story.
            </p>
            <p>
                I go by the name Osha, a devoted student of Japanese literature
                nestled in the landscapes of East Java, Indonesia. Embrace the
                truth—I'm a certified weeb. My journey into Japanese language embarked
                precisely when I set foot into the realm of college life. Picture
                this: August 2020, a clueless soul armed with meager knowledge of
                hiragana and katakana. A genuine dumbass, if you will.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward, and Japanese became a central focus in my academic
                endeavors. It's not just a subject; it's the heartbeat of my major.
                Yet, the language, elusive as it may be, 頭に入らなかった—didn't quite
                click. Surviving the initial years, I even dared to challenge the JLPT
                N3 exams twice, only to face crushing defeats. December brought
                another attempt,
                <s><a href="#updates_jlptresult">results still pending</a></s>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assessing my Japanese proficiency, I'd modestly place myself at the N3
                level, though perhaps that's a generous estimation. It's time for a
                perspective shift. No longer a self-proclaimed expert, I'll now
                embrace the role of an ordinary individual. Hard work and hustle are
                the new mantras; after all, no one is born special. Well, maybe
                0.000001% of the population, but certainly not me—a normal person,
                traversing a realm of linguistic complexities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this blog post, I extend an invitation for you to witness my
                odyssey, a pursuit marked by the determination to achieve the coveted
                合格 status in the JLPT N1. May my narrative inspire you, urging you
                to toil and grind alongside me. Let's set our sights on the pinnacle
                of achievement.

            <h2>My Method to Learn Japanese</h2>
            <p>
                Let's be honest—learning Japanese is a genuine pain in the ass. It's
                not a casual stroll in the linguistic park; it's a rigorous climb up a
                mountain of hiragana, katakana, and the formidable kanji. Their
                phonology dances to a different beat than English, but thankfully, I'm
                Indonesian—a small blessing, considering our somewhat similar
                pronunciations. Yet, the journey takes a twist; enter bunpo—the
                labyrinth of Japanese grammar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh my god indeed. Japanese boasts an array of bunpo, each more
                intricate than the last. It's so bewildering that distinguishing one
                from another feels like deciphering an ancient script. The struggle is
                real, my friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, you might be curious—what's my secret method for tackling this
                linguistic maze? Stay tuned as I unveil the unique concoction of
                strategies that keeps me afloat in this sea of characters and
                grammatical nuances. The journey is arduous, but the pursuit of
                language mastery is a thrilling adventure in its own right. Let me be
                your guide through the perplexities of learning Japanese.

                        <p>
                            Every day, I plunge into the vibrant world of Japanese content.
                            Anime, my daily visual escapade, takes the lead. Some folks
                            argue that anime isn't the "real" Japanese experience, but hey,
                            I've stumbled upon locals singing its praises. Confusing, right?
                            Regardless, I shamelessly indulge in anime, driven more by love
                            than linguistic purity. By the way, fun fact: I binged on 58
                            anime titles last year—talk about passion!

                            Beyond anime, Japanese vlogs paint a lively picture of daily
                            life. I gravitate toward those without English subtitles or,
                            even better, with Japanese subtitles. Check out this channel
                            that's got me hooked. She make lots of fun vlog and Japanese
                            learning related videos.

                            by themselves. I'll definitely doing that if I had enough time.

                            my ears daily. "ムスビメ" and "Spiral," the earworms from the
                            last season's Mushoku Tensei soundtrack, have found a cozy spot
                            in my playlists. And Yuika? She's got the sweetest voice ever,
                            and her simple yet touching lyrics hit differently. Go check her
                            music.

                            Immersing yourself in Japanese content isn't just
                            entertainment—it's a subconscious memory game. Words, kanji,
                            grammatical patterns sneak into your mind effortlessly.

                            Recognizing the limitations of pure immersion, I acknowledge
                            that, unlike infants, my cognitive mechanisms are no longer
                            optimized for seamless word acquisition. As someone well into
                            their half-twenties, the need for a more structured study
                            regimen becomes apparent. In this pursuit, I've discovered a
                            valuable resource—a repository of past JLPT exam papers,
                            including a formidable 1300 N1 grammar questions.

                            a disciplined routine—answering 10 questions daily, now on a

            <p>
                The meticulous process of crafting PowerPoint presentations proved to
                be labor-intensive, prompting a strategic shift in my approach.
                Instead, I redirected my focus towards immersive reading, accompanied
                by diligent note-taking within a dedicated document. Subsequently, I
                transcribe these insights onto this
                <a href="https://blog.oshapermadi.my.id/search/label/JLPT">blog</a>.
                The efficacy of this method is discernible through a tangible
                improvement in <a href="#point-history">my assessment scores</a>. I am
                committed to consistently updating these notes as my understanding of
                grammatical nuances evolves.
                <br />
                Furthermore, contemplations are underway regarding the integration of
                a dedicated section within the blog to catalog my expanding
                vocabulary. However, the exploration of refined and aesthetically
                pleasing methods for this purpose is an ongoing endeavor. On a
                positive note, I recently discovered a YouTube channel that adeptly
                elucidates complex grammar points, presented entirely in Japanese.

                Hey there, quick update on my daily quizzes. Unfortunately, my scores
                haven't seen much improvement over the past 15 days (except for a
                brief hiatus from December 12-14 due to attending my girlfriend's
                graduation ceremony – priorities, right?). Feeling a bit stuck, I

                Enter the Anki Deck project. This time, I'm not just relying on

                vocabulary Anki Deck for "天気の子" (Weathering with You) – yep,
                revisiting that light novel after three years since I first got my
                hands on it. This time, I'm committed to reading it cover to cover.
                Once completed, I'll make the deck available to the public, chapter by
                chapter. Admittedly, I've only finished Page 1 of the prologue, so
                don't hold your breath just yet.
            </p>

            <p>That's the scoop for now. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

                    Today marks a significant juncture—the release of the JLPT results.
                    The outcome is in, and to be honest, it's a miss. Just a mere 3
                    points shy, but hey, no biggie. I see it as a minor setback on the
                    road to triumph. The plan? Redemption in December—I'm eyeing that
                    N1, skipping past N3-N2. This setback served as a poignant
                    realization: learning does make a difference. My initial attempts
                    hovered around 68-69 points, and now, a solid 92. That's nearly half
                    the gap closed, thanks to dedicated learning over the past 3-4
                    months. A reassuring testament to the impact of consistent effort.

                    Here's the real talk—this JLPT isn't just a test; it's my ticket out
                    of Indonesia. Nailing N1 this year is non-negotiable, and I'm dead
                    serious about it. Today's update may be a checkpoint, but the
                    journey is far from over. Stay tuned for the next updates.
