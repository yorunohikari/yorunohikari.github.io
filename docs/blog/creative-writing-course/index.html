                During the last semester, I enrolled in a captivating Creative Writing course. The class proved to be
                engaging, with our teacher assigning us stimulating projects. These comprised four distinct assignments:
                crafting a short story, composing five poems, creating a Travel Notes piece, and scripting a drama.
                Through these endeavors, I gleaned invaluable insights.

            <h2>Short Story: "Tuhan Tidak Lagi Bersamamu"</h2>
            <p>
                In my short story, I delved into the narrative of a fallen angel who, while observing human history
                unfold, grapples with existential dilemmas. Themes of morality, the nature of suffering, and the essence
                of existence were intricately woven into the storyline. <a

                </div>    
                

            </p>
            <h2>Poems: A Selection of Five Poems</h2>
            <p>
                My poetic endeavors ranged from contemplations on existence to passionate declarations of love. I even
                experimented with meta-poetry, leveraging HTML capabilities to enhance the creative expression. <a
                    href="poems\poems.html">here</a>.
                <iframe id="myFrame2" src="poems\poems.html" width="100%" height="300"></iframe>
            </p>
            <h2>Travel Notes: "Jalan Jalan Malang</h2>
            <p>
                For the Travel Notes assignment, we were tasked with embarking on a leisurely stroll through the streets
                of Malang city, keenly observing our surroundings to later encapsulate our experiences in writing.

            </p>
            <h2>Drama Script: "Pada Suatu Ketika</h2>
            <p>
                In the realm of drama scripting, I embraced full creative liberty by blending elements of existing
                Indonesian legends with original narrative concepts, resulting in a captivating new storyline.

            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I found immense enjoyment and enrichment in this course, deepening my appreciation for the art
                of creative expression.
