            <p>The Infinite Monkey Theorem is a fascinating concept in probability theory that captures my imagination.
                It
                states that if I were to provide a monkey with a typewriter keyboard and an infinite amount of time,
                this
                monkey would almost surely type any given text, including the complete works of William Shakespeare.</p>

            <p>This thought experiment explores the idea that even though the probability of such an event is
                astronomically
                low, given unlimited time, it would eventually happen. In this context, "almost surely" is a
                mathematical
                term indicating an event that happens with a probability of 1.</p>

            <p>Now, let's connect this idea to my own version of the Infinite Monkey Theorem:</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Random Text Generator</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>Below, you'll find a random text generator that generates a sequence of characters randomly. While it's
                far
                from an actual monkey with a typewriter, this generator provides a simplified demonstration of how
                randomness can produce text.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-frame">
            <p class="random-text" id="random-text"></p>
            <button id="refresh-button" onclick="generateRandomText()">Generate</button>
            <button id="play-button" onclick="togglePlay()">Play</button>
        </div>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>This random text generator illustrates the concept of generating text through randomness. Just like the
                Infinite Monkey Theorem suggests that given enough time, even an abstract device can produce meaningful
                text, my random text generator uses a limited set of characters to create a sequence of characters in a
                similar spirit.</p>

            <p>While the complete works of Shakespeare may remain elusive to my random generator, it's a playful
                exploration
                of the improbable becoming possible in the world of infinite possibilities.</p>
