                <p>This morning, I woke up exhausted. I had slept for hours, but it wasn’t enough. I could’ve easily
                    stayed in bed forever.</p>
                <p>My throat hurt. The air in my room felt toxic—heavy, stale. Even my pillow didn’t feel right. It used
                    to fluff up just the way I liked. Now it’s like it’s given up, too.</p>
                <p>My head hurt, not a headache, I guess. Just… pressure.</p>
                <p>I looked at my phone. I had put it on airplane mode before sleeping, and now I didn’t want to turn it
                    back on. No one texts me anyway.</p>
                <p>I felt hungry, but didn’t want to eat. Even my favorite food doesn’t taste like anything anymore.</p>
                <p>I thought about going outside. I should go outside.<br>But I didn’t want to.</p>
                <p>Should I take a shower? Maybe tonight.</p>
                <p>I miss my girlfriend. I wonder if she misses me, too. There’s so much I want to say to her, but I
                    don’t know how to say it.</p>
                <p>I want to go home. But I’m scared.. I’ll disappoint my parents.</p>
                <p>I don’t know what to do.<br>But I know I need to do <em>something</em>.<br>The problem is… for what?
                </p>
                <p>Isn’t life meaningless?</p>
                <p>I’ve tried giving it meaning. I’ve tried having goals. I’ve tried being motivated. But no, my brain
                    pushes it all away.</p>
                <p>Do I hate myself? Probably.<br>Do I want to die? No.</p>
                <p>I have too many things I still want to do.<br>I just want someone to notice me.<br>I crave
                    connection.<br>I want someone to care.<br>I want someone to listen.</p>
