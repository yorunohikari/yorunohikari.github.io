                <p>So, I’ve been using Linux for over a month now. In this post, I’ll share my experience, what led
                    me here, what I’ve learned, and whether I recommend it.</p>

                    <h2>How It All Started?</h2>

                    <p>The story begins around three months ago. I was using my 6-year-old laptop like usual—watching
                        YouTube, anime, browsing Reddit, etc. It was running Windows 11.
                    </p>

                    </br>

                    <p>Then, the Wi-Fi started acting up. It kept disconnecting randomly, and sometimes the adapter
                        would
                        just disappear. A quick restart would fix it temporarily, but over time, it got worse. My phone
                        worked fine, and my router seemed okay too, so I knew the issue was with the laptop.</p>

                    </br>

                    <p>I searched online and most people pointed to a driver issue. I reinstalled the driver—but nothing
                        changed. The disconnection happened every 5 minutes. It became unbearable.
                    </p>

                <h2>Why Linux (Kind of by Accident)</h2>

                <p>Around this time, my friend’s laptop also broke. It wouldn’t boot and kept showing a drive error. He
                    was also using Windows 11. I took a look and suspected it was a drive failure. As a classic move, I
                    unplugged and replugged the SSD (technician style), but no luck.
                </p>

                </br>

                <p>Then I had an idea: “What if I use a live USB OS to check if the drive is even detected?” That’s when
                    I discovered you could do that with Linux. I downloaded the Fedora ISO, created a bootable USB, and
                    tested his laptop. Sadly, the drive wasn’t detected—most likely a hardware failure. He later took it
                    to a service center and got it replaced.</p>

                </br>

                <p>But with Fedora still on my USB, I thought—why not try it on my laptop?
                </p>

                </br>

                <p>I booted Fedora and did my usual things: YouTube, browsing, etc. And guess what? The network issue
                    was gone. Completely gone. That’s when I seriously considered switching.
                </p>

                <h2>Distro</h2>

                <p>After some research on Reddit and YouTube, I decided to try EndeavourOS—an Arch-based distro. I
                    dual-booted it alongside my broken Windows 11 (just in case I messed something up). I used Endeavour
                    for about a week and loved it.
                </p>

                </br>

                <p>Then I thought, “Maybe it’s time to grow up and install actual Arch.”</p>

                </br>

                <p>So I did.
                </p>

                </br>

                <p>I didn’t know archinstall was a thing back then, so I went the manual route—configuring everything,
                    installing packages myself, and watching a lot of YouTube tutorials.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <a href="https://archinstall.archlinux.page/" class="link">archinstall</a> is a helper library which
                    automates
                    the installation of Arch Linux. It is packaged with different pre-configured installers, such as a
                    "guided" installer.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Ricing Time</h2>

                <p>After installation, I quickly dove into ricing.
                </p>

                </br>

                <p>At first, I used <a href="https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV2" class="link">Hyprv2</a> dotfiles.
                    They were simple but hadn’t been maintained in a while, so I switched to <a
                        href="https://github.com/meowrch/meowrch" class="link">meowrch</a> dotfiles and used
                    them as my base rice.”</p>
                </br>

                <h3>meowrch -> eudaimon</h3>

                <p>I wanted a login page that matched my style, so I edited the background and theme configs.
                    Next up, the boot menu. I use GRUB, and yes—turn out you can customize it. I created a custom
                    background and
                    adjusted the theme configs. I loved how it turned out.
                    Then came the tricky part: Waybar.
                    With no formal programming background, figuring out how it worked was a pain in the ass. After a lot
                    of trial
                    and error, I finally got the look I
                    wanted.
                    I used this setup for about a month and was really satisfied.
                </p>

                </br>

                <div id="p-container">
                    <div id="lightbox">
                        <img id="lightbox-image" src="" alt="Full size image">
                        <button id="close-button">×</button>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>HyDE</h3>

                <p>A few days ago, I found a beautiful set of dotfiles on GitHub called HyDE. I said, “Fuck it, let’s
                    install it.”
                </p>

                </br>

                <p>But here’s something you should know: when using someone else's dotfiles, you have to check what
                    packages and paths they use. Otherwise, the old setup might still run in the background due to
                    custom paths or configs. There's no universal dotfiles uninstaller—so cleanup is manual. (Or maybe
                    there is one… I’m not sure.)</p>

                </br>

                <p>Anyway, HyDE came with a cyberpunk Edgerunners theme—which I absolutely loved. So I used it and
                    customized some parts myself. As usual, I made sure the SDDM and GRUB matched the style for a
                    consistent rice.</p>

                </br>

                <div id="q-container">
                    <div id="lightbox">
                        <img id="lightbox-image" src="" alt="Full size image">
                        <button id="close-button">×</button>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>Using Linux gave me something I didn’t expect: freedom.</p>

                </br>

                <p>I get to choose every program I need. I can customize virtually everything. I even learned some
                    terminal commands along the way. The experience has been so fun.</p>

                </br>

                <p>Would I recommend Linux?</p>

                </br>

                <p>Yes, especially if you're tired of bloated, corporate-controlled software. If you’re done with
                    mediocrity and want to take back control of your machine, Linux is the way.</p>

                </br>

                <p>It’s a journey and I’m so glad I took it.<span class="cursor">█</span></p>
