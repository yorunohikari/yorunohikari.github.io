                        <p>It was mid-September, just as the rainy season had begun, when I had a strange dream. In it,
                            I reconnected with my high school friend, Luna. The last time I saw her was at a barbecue
                            party in 2012, about three years after we graduated. In the dream, I remembered everything
                            in vivid detail. She called me, saying she had some questions about her work. I didn’t
                            mind—we had been close in high school, though time and our different paths had separated us.
                        </p>

                        <p>We talked for hours. While we only discussed her work for about half an hour, the rest of the
                            time was spent reminiscing about our high school days. Somehow, we agreed to meet up. She
                            worked near where I lived, so it felt like a natural reunion. We walked around town,
                            enjoying each other’s company, and had dinner afterward.</p>

                        <p>I saw her so clearly—her pure smile, her dark eyes, and the faint freckles on her face. She
                            seemed genuinely happy, as if something good had happened, though she never told me what.
                            Strangely, I found myself talking a lot in the dream. Normally, I’m quiet and only speak
                            when necessary, but this time, I felt an urgency to say everything on my mind, as if I might
                            never get the chance to talk to her again.</p>

                        <p>Silence. For a moment, you could almost hear the birds outside as clearly as if we were there
                            with them.</p>

                        <p>This vivid dream still lingers with me sometimes.</p>
