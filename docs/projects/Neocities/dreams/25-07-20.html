                        <p>I was at the shore — the beach southwest of the city, the same place I first met my
                            girlfriend. I had planned to solo camp there, just me and the sea for a night. But the
                            weather report warned of a heavy storm approaching. Camping was prohibited.
                        </p>

                        <p>It was 3:30 in the afternoon. I wandered along the tide line. The waves were light — low tide
                            — and the reef was clearly visible. Dozens of sea urchins clung to the rocks beneath the
                            shallow water. I’ve always been fascinated by sea creatures. They’re strange and obscure —
                            alien, almost.
                        </p>

                        <p>As I turned to head back to my car, I saw someone walking beneath the line of coconut trees.
                            A girl. She wasn't here for the beach; her field suit made that clear. She walked in the
                            same direction I was heading. As I got closer, I recognized her.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Luna?!”</span></p>

                        <p>She turned and smiled — that soft, familiar smile — and waved. <span
                                class="dialogue">“Hi.”</span></p>

                        <p>I picked up my pace.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“What are you doing here?”</span> I asked.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“I was volunteering, but the event got cancelled.”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Because of the storm?”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah. We were supposed to do a ghost gear clean up, but they say it’s
                                going to be a big one tonight. So… they called it off. What about you? Are you enjoying the
                                beach?”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Sort of. I brought gear to camp here overnight. Everything’s packed
                                and ready — but yeah, the storm ruined that plan. Are you heading back?”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah, hoping to catch a bus.”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“At this hour? I don’t think there’ll be any. I’ll drive you.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>We walked together toward my car.</p>


                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Whoa, you really were prepared,” </span>
                            she said, eyeing the pile of camping gear tossed across the passenger seat.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah… sorry for the mess,” </span> I laughed. <span
                                class="dialogue">“Didn’t think anyone else would see it. I was planning a solo
                                trip.”</span></p>

                        <p>I started the engine and pulled onto the road.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“So you do this often? Solo camping?”</span> she asked.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Not until recently. I saw a show about solo camping, and thought I’d
                                give it a
                                try. Turns out, it’s pretty chill. I enjoyed it more than I expected.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“That sounds fun,”</span> she said, smiling.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“What about you? Do you volunteer a lot? Back in school, you weren’t
                                exactly the ‘nature type.’”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>She chuckled. <span class="dialogue">“Not really. I’ve only done it a couple times — mostly
                                here. Just killing time, I guess.”
                            </span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“At that beach? I think I volunteered there a few months ago too. It
                                was a turtle hatchling release. That was fun.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“I’ve never done the hatchling thing. Maybe I’ll try that next
                                time.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>Half an hour passed. We were still talking — about camping, nature, tide pools, and gear. I
                            might’ve gone overboard with my obsession, rambling about how disappointed I was that I
                            couldn’t camp tonight.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Hey,”</span> she said, <span class="dialogue">“why don’t we cook
                                something at my place?” </span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“No, no. You’re my guest tonight. I’ll cook for you.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Ooh, okay, chef. Do we need to hunt first?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah. We’ll chase down a wild turkey at Countdown,”</span> I grinned.
                        </p>

                        <p>We laughed and joked all the way home.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“You live here?”</span> she asked when we arrived. <span
                                class="dialogue">“It’s like five minutes from my place!”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Exactly! I don’t get how we never ran into each other. Do you even
                                leave your room?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Ouch. That hits deep. Houston, I’m down,”
                            </span> she said dramatically.
                        </p>

                        <p>My place was the polar opposite of hers — minimalist, clean, impersonal. Furniture like
                            something out of a showroom. But we had one thing in common: a shelf full of vinyl records.
                        </p>

                        <p>Rain had started falling. The forecast said the storm would hit in three hours — but it was
                            already picking up.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s earlier than expected,”</span> I muttered while warming my
                            already cooked pot au feu.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Need help, chef?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah, actually. Can you go play something from the shelf?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Geez, I meant help with the cooking,”</span> she mumbled, grinning.
                        </p>

                        <p>She browsed the records.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“I’ve never heard of any of these,”</span> she said, holding up Scary
                            Monsters and Nice Sprites.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“That was huge back then. Skrillex? No?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>She shook her head. I remembered then — her collection was mostly classical piano. No
                            electronic drops or dance beats.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Play that one. Skip to track four. It’s dance music, so… low
                                volume.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Aye aye, chef.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>The music played. She started dancing — awkwardly, like someone who’d never been to a party.
                            Probably hadn’t. I smiled — caught between amusement and something warmer.</p>

                        <p>Dinner was ready not long after. I placed the plates on the table.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“For you, mademoiselle — Pot au Feu and tartiflette,”</span> I said in
                            an exaggerated French accent. <span class="dialogue">“Tonight’s special includes bœuf,
                                fondant carrots, leeks braised in vegetable broth, and honey-glazed turnips. A reduction
                                of the jus ties it together — with a touch of sel de Guérande, of course. Bon
                                appétit.”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Oui, merci merci,”
                            </span> she said with a playful smirk.
                        </p>

                        <p>She took a bite and paused for a moment. <span class="dialogue">“Did you take a cooking
                                course?”
                            </span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Nah, I’ve been cooking since I moved out. My mom always said, ‘Learn
                                to make good food, and you’ll never have bad days.’”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Well… I’d never have a bad day if I got meals like this.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>Outside, the rain thickened into a heavy pour. The storm had fully arrived. Getting her home
                            wasn’t an option anymore.</p>

                        <p>We moved to the couch and played games. She mentioned having a Switch at her place too — so
                            she clearly dabbled. We played Mario Kart. I lost. Repeatedly.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Is that all you got?”</span> she teased.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“How are you this good?”</span> I groaned. <span class="dialogue">“Is
                                this the result of never leaving your room?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Haha, very funny. Here—take this!!!”</span> She said, dropping shell
                            on my kart.
                        </p>

                        <p>The night stretched on. We talked about life — things I never knew about her, things a
                            “friend” doesn’t usually share. Eventually, it got late.</p>

                        <p>I offered her my bed and took the couch.</p>

                        <p>But I couldn’t sleep.</p>

                        <p>Not with her in my room. The last time I stayed at her place, I slept fine. But now?
                            Something felt… off. Guilt? Confusion? I had a girlfriend. Was this cheating? Did I want it
                            to be?</p>

                        <p>I sat there, staring at the wall.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“<span class="redacted">███</span>,”</span> she whispered from the
                            bedroom,
                            <span class="dialogue">“I can’t sleep.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>Her voice was soft, almost ghostly.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Me too,”</span> I said.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Want to lie down?”</span></p>

                        <p>I hesitated. My heart thudded. <span class="dialogue">“Sure.”</span></p>

                        <p>We lay under the blanket, a slight distance between us.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s getting cold,” </span> She said.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah,”</span> I replied.
                        </p>

                        <p>She turned, her back facing me — and then slowly closed the space between us, her back
                            touching my shoulder.</p>

                        <p>I didn’t know what came over me. I turned toward her and gently wrapped my arm around her,
                            hugging her from behind.</p>

                        <p>Her body met mine like it belonged there — soft, familiar, and impossibly warm. The air
                            between us disappeared. I could feel the quiet rhythm of her breath, steady and slow, rising
                            and falling beneath my arm. Her spine pressed lightly against my chest, and in that
                            closeness, I could feel her heartbeat — a subtle, fluttering echo, like wings brushing
                            against skin.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s warm,”</span> she murmured.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah,”</span> I said, my voice barely a breath, as my fingers
                            searched for hers.
                        </p>

                        <p>She held my hand.</p>

                        <p>Her palm was warm, her grip gentle but certain. Her thumb moved once across my knuckles —
                            barely a motion, yet it said everything. The silence around us grew thick, loud in its
                            stillness, like the world had paused just for this one fragile moment. I could hear nothing
                            but the soft, shared rhythm of our breathing, and the hush that falls when two people stop
                            pretending.
                        </p>

                        <p>Her hair tickled my cheek. It smelled like vanilla — sweet, nostalgic, like the kind of
                            comfort that sneaks up on you. I leaned in slightly, closing my eyes as the scent wrapped
                            around me, pulling me deeper into something I didn’t want to name. Something too tender.
                        </p>

                        <p>Time didn’t pass. It just… hovered there, holding its breath.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“I’ll see you next time,”</span> she whispered.
                        </p>

                        <p>And we fell asleep.
                        </p>
