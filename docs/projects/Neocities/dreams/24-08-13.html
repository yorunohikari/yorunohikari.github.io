                        <p>It was the first week of our second year. The faint sound of birds chirping outside the
                            school mixed with the gentle hum of the air conditioner. The occasional shuffle of a chair
                            or the soft flip of a page added to the quiet atmosphere of the classroom. Ms. Linda, our
                            physics teacher, was just explaining
                            Newton's laws of motion. I'd already studied this topic ages ago—being the science nerd I
                            was—so naturally, I was bored.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Any questions?"</span> Ms. Linda
                            asked, her eyes sweeping across the class.</p>

                        <p>I raised my hand, more out of a desire to break the boredom than anything else.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Yes, <span class="redacted">███</span>?"</span> Ms. Linda nodded at
                            me with a smile that encouraged
                            curiosity.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Does Newton's law apply to every object? What if the object moves
                                nearly at the speed of light?"</span> I asked, though I already knew the answer.</p>

                        <p>The classroom fell silent for a moment. Even my classmates who were usually half-asleep
                            seemed to perk up at the question. Ms. Linda's eyes lit
                            up with the kind of excitement teachers get when a student asks something that goes beyond
                            the curriculum.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“That’s a great question, <span class="redacted">████</span>,”</span>
                            Ms. Linda said, her voice brightening. <span class="dialogue">“Before I answer, does anyone
                                else want to take a
                                shot?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>Silence. For a moment, you could almost hear the birds outside as clearly as if we were there
                            with them.</p>

                        <p>Then, a girl sitting two rows from the front raised her hand.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yes, Luna?”</span> Ms. Linda
                            asked, her tone even more excited now.</p>

                        <p>That was the first time I really noticed her. I didn't even know her name until that moment.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Well,”</span>Luna
                            began, her voice confident but thoughtful, <span class="dialogue">“for most things, like
                                tennis balls, cars, or planets, Newton's laws work fine. But when you’re talking about
                                objects moving close to the speed of light, that’s when Einstein's theory of relativity
                                comes into play.”</span></p>

                        <p>Her short, dark golden hair swayed as she spoke, and she occasionally glanced upward, as if
                            searching for the right words.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Interesting,”</span>
                            Ms. Linda encouraged <span class="dialogue">“Go
                                on.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“In Einstein’s special relativity, when things move close to the speed
                                of light, time and space behave differently. In Newton’s world, time is constant for
                                everyone. But in Einstein’s theory, time can slow down for objects moving really
                                fast—like near-light speed. It’s called time dilation. So, Newton’s second law, F = ma,
                                doesn't exactly work anymore, because mass increases at those speeds.”</span></p>

                        <p>Luna finished her explanation with a smile, her dark eyes turning to meet mine.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“That was an excellent explanation, Luna,” </span>
                            Ms. Linda said, clearly impressed.<span class="dialogue">“Does that answer your question,
                                <span class="redacted">███</span>?”
                            </span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah, that pretty much covers it, thank you,” </span> I replied. But
                            my thoughts were elsewhere—on Luna. Most students wouldn't know about advanced physics like
                            that. She was probably a science nerd like me.
                        </p>

                        <p>Ms. Linda clapped her hands softly to bring the class back together. <span
                                class="dialogue">“Okay, I know this might seem complicated, but don't worry—we won't be
                                studying Einstein’s theories just yet. For now, we'll focus on Newton's laws, which will
                                be on your assessments.”
                            </span>
                        </p>

                        <p>A small wave of relief swept through the class as students resumed taking notes.
                        </p>

                        <p>That was my first real encounter with Luna—the moment I realized there was something about
                            her I hadn't noticed before.
                        </p>
