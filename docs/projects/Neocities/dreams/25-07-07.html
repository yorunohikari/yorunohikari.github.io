                        <p>It was one of those strange dreams again.</p>

                        <p>This time, I already had a girlfriend. We were in a long-distance relationship—four months
                            in. I met her during a volunteer event at a southern beach. We were releasing sea turtle
                            hatchlings into the sea, teaching schoolchildren from the nearby area to keep the beach
                            clean and to leave the turtles alone. After that day, we kept in touch. Went out a couple of
                            times. Eventually, we started dating.
                        </p>

                        <p>It’s July now. She’s back in her hometown, and I’m still here—in this cold, mostly empty
                            town. Days blur together. I went to work. Logged out at five. My friend called and asked if
                            I wanted to grab a drink. We met at our usual bar.</p>

                        <p>We ordered some raw beer and talked for a while. It was almost eight. The atmosphere was
                            relaxed, quiet. Just a handful of people. Lofi jazz played in the background like wallpaper.
                        </p>

                        <p>After about four glasses, I was starting to feel it—just a bit tipsy, but still sharp. My
                            friend and I had run out of things to say, so we just sat there, letting the moment breathe.
                        </p>

                        <p>That’s when a girl stepped up beside me to order something.</p>


                        <p><span class="dialogue">“One mojito, please.”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Sure thing,”</span> the bartender replied. <span
                                class="dialogue">“Classic, or you want something fruity? We’ve got mango.”
                            </span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Just classic, please.”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Got it. One moment.”</span></p>

                        <p>I recognized that voice. I’d heard it before—about a year ago. But something in it had
                            shifted. Softer, a little sadder.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“…Luna?”</span></p>

                        <p>She turned and smiled. <span class="dialogue">“Hey, <span class="redacted">███</span>. I
                                haven’t seen you in a while. How’s life?”</span></p>

                        <p>It was her again. Luna. I remembered meeting her in a dream. And even now, I knew this was a
                            dream too. But somehow, within this dream, I remembered the last one.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“I’m good,”</span> I said. <span class="dialogue">“Just living slowly
                                in boring old <span class="redacted">███</span>, I guess. How about you? Still at
                                Siemens?”
                            </span></p>

                        <p>She laughed. <span class="dialogue">“You’re funny.” </span>But the laugh didn’t reach her
                            eyes.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah… I’m still there. But I don’t know. Lately, I just feel
                                stuck.”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“What’s going on?” </span> I asked. <span class="dialogue">“Talk to
                                me.”
                            </span></p>

                        <p>She did. She talked about how everything felt repetitive—how she woke up every morning
                            dreading the same cycle. She told me about a show she was obsessed with. Little things from
                            her week. And at some point, without either of us meaning to, we started reminiscing about
                            our high school days again.</p>

                        <p>I must’ve made a weird face, because she tilted her head and asked, <span
                                class="dialogue">“Hey, what’s wrong? You look like you’re somewhere else.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Ah, it’s nothing,”</span>
                            I said. <span class="dialogue">“Just… déjà vu. I swear we’ve talked about this
                                before.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>She paused. Her eyes lingered on mine.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Now that you mention it… I feel like we have. But I can’t remember
                                when.”</span></p>

                        <p>We let that thought hang in the air for a second—then let it go. Drifted into another topic.
                        </p>

                        <p>My friend eventually said goodnight and left. He probably sensed I had more to say to Luna.
                            It was almost midnight. I was tired, but I didn’t want the conversation to end.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Why don’t you come to my place?”</span> she asked.</p>

                        <p>I hesitated. I hadn’t told her I had a girlfriend. Maybe that was wrong. But I just nodded.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Sure. Right now?”</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Let’s go.”</span></p>

                        <p>I paid for our drinks, even though she tried to. Her apartment was just around the corner—two
                            blocks from mine.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“How come I never see you?”</span> I asked as we walked.</p>

                        <p>She smiled. <span class="dialogue">“I barely go out. That bar… even though it’s so close,
                                this was my first time going.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“Yeah, I’d know. I’m basically part of the furniture there.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>She laughed again. <span class="dialogue">“Want me to make you a sandwich?”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“A warm sandwich sounds amazing.”</span></p>

                        <p>Her place was quiet and warm. Rustic. The kind of space where someone lives alone but makes
                            it feel like home. Plants near the window. A shelf full of vinyl records. That
                            millennial-coded charm.
                        </p>

                        <p>We sat on her couch and ate sandwiches while watching her favorite show. Two, maybe three episodes passed. At some point, she started dozing off.
                        </p>

                        <p>I carried her to the bed, gently. She didn’t wake.
                        </p>

                        <p>I curled up on the sofa and closed my eyes.
                        </p>

                        <p>Right before the dream slipped away, I heard her voice again. Faint.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">“I think this is goodbye again.”</span></p>

                        <p>And then I woke up in my own bed.
                        </p>
