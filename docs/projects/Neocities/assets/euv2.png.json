    "description": "This image shows a stylized computer login screen. On the left side, there is a logo with a large, ornate cross with branches of leaves wrapped around the bottom of it. Below the logo, the words \"ORDO EUDAIMON\" are written in a metallic gold font.\n\nOn the right side of the screen, a login box is framed by a glowing rectangular border. Inside the box, at the top, is a circular profile picture of a character with short, teal-colored hair and large, expressive eyes. Below the profile picture are two input fields: one for a username, which is filled with \"eudaimonia,\" and one for a password, which is obscured by asterisks. There is a button below the input fields that says \"Enter.\"\n\nAt the bottom of the login box are two circular icons: a power symbol and what appears to be a settings or gear icon. In the very bottom right corner of the screen, small text reads \"Eudaimonia - Mainframe.\" The background is a deep, solid blue."
