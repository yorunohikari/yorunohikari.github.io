    "description": "This image is a screenshot of a computer desktop, showing a dark, command-line interface with light-colored text. The screen is divided into two main sections.\n\nOn the left, a terminal window displays the output of system commands. Text shows a user updating system packages, with messages like \"Synchronizing package databases...\" and \"Starting full system upgrade... there is nothing to do.\" The output also shows the time the command was executed and how long it took.\n\nOn the right, another terminal window is open. The top part displays the output of a command that shows a stylized, minimalist black cat with large white eyes and ears, with a purple swirl shape in its body. Below the cat graphic, system information is listed in colored text, including details about the operating system (\"OS: Arch Linux\"), kernel version, and the number of installed packages. Further down, there is a second block of information providing hardware details such as the CPU (\"AMD Athlon 300U\"), GPU (\"AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics\"), and system uptime.\n\nA status bar is visible at the top of the entire screen, with icons and numbers for battery, network, time, and other system statistics. The overall aesthetic is that of a customized, text-based desktop environment."
