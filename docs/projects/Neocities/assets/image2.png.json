    "description": "This is a screenshot of a music player application running on a desktop, with a dark and minimalist theme. The application's window has a thick, bright yellow border.\n\nOn the left side of the window, there is a playlist section with columns for \"Artist,\" \"Title,\" \"Album,\" and \"Duration.\" The songs listed are all by the artist \"Bring Me the Horizon,\" with the title \"fresh bruises\" highlighted in yellow, indicating it's the currently playing track. The play time is displayed as \"0:57 / 3:18.\"\n\nOn the right side of the window, a large album art image is displayed. It shows a compact disc with a red heart and floral pattern on a white background, all sealed in a clear plastic sleeve. Below the album art, lyrics are displayed in a light-colored font. The repeated line \"Don't you hide your love\" is visible multiple times.\n\nAt the top of the application window, a status bar shows the current song title and artist, \"fresh bruises - Bring Me the Horizon,\" along with playback controls like \"Repeat,\" \"Random,\" and \"Volume.\" The top of the entire desktop screen has a separate status bar with icons and numbers for system information."
