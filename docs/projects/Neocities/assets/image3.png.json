    "description": "This image is a screenshot of a user interface, RETROARCH, with a PlayStation-like theme. The background is a solid blue color.\n\nOn the left side of the screen, there is a vertical list of menu options, represented by icons. The second option, a PlayStation controller icon, is highlighted. To the right of the controller icon, a list of game titles is shown, with \"Azumanga Donjara Daiou (Japan)\" highlighted. Other titles visible are \"Crash Bandicoot - Warped (USA),\" \"Silent Hill (Japan) (Rev 1),\" \"Touge Max G (Japan),\" and \"World Soccer Winning Eleven 2002 (Japan).\"\n\nOn the bottom left, the text \"1.20.0 - Beetle PSX HW (0.9.44.1 8b27054)\" is displayed, which appears to be version information for the emulator software.\n\nOn the right side of the screen, a large game cover art is visible for the highlighted game, \"Azumanga Donjara Daiou.\" The cover features several anime-style cartoon characters. The top right corner of the screen shows the date and time \"23-07 13:47\" and a battery icon with \"100%\" next to it. The top of the entire desktop has a separate status bar with more icons."
